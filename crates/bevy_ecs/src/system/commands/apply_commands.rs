    /// ```
    /// # use bevy_ecs::prelude::*;
    /// # use bevy_ecs::system::ApplyCommands;
    ///
    /// let mut world = World::default();
    /// let entity = world.apply_commands(|_world, mut commands| {
    ///     commands.spawn_empty().id()
    /// });
    /// # assert!(world.get_entity(entity).is_some());
